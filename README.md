# Research Project
Does Employment status and social engagement predict SWL and Happiness?

## Introduction
- High rates of anxiety often associated with insecure employment (Wolff, A. D., 2008)
- Happiness increases with more social exchanges. (Masterson et al. 2021)
- Can employment status and social interaction both predict life satisfaction and happiness?

## Methods
Participants
- N = 7644 adults from an open source dataset in National Wellbeing Survey. a US research study (Monnat et al. 2022)
  - Adults aged 18 to 64 recruited online via Qualtrics sending surveys to emails.
  - *M*age = 41; *SD*: 13.6
  - 47.8% Male, 51.8% Female, 0.5% Other

Measures
- Life Satisfaction measured through Diemer Satisfaction With Life Scale
  - Cronbach alpha: 0.864
  - Life Satisfaction Factor Loading range: 0.573 - 0.859
- Happiness measured via one prompt:
  - *“Taking all things together, would you say you are: Very Happy, Rather Happy, Not Very Happy, Not At All Happy.”*
- Employment Status measured by two items:
  - Yes or no to “One Job”, *“Multiple Jobs”*
- Social Interaction measured via one prompt:
  - *“Thinking about the past 12 months, how often did you engage in the following activities? Get together socially with friends or relatives.”*
